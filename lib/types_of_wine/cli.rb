          Description: Cabernet Sauvignon is a full-bodied red grape first heavily planted in the
                      Bordeaux region.Today, itâ€™s the most popular wine variety in the world.
                      Wines are full-bodied with bold tannins and a long persistent finish driven
                      mostly by the higher levels of alcohol and tannin that often
                      accompany these wines.
          Food Pairing: lamb, beef, smoked meats, French, American, firm cheeses like aged cheddar and hard cheeses like Pecorino"
